The steps are steep but well-maintained, and the gradual ascent allows you to enjoy the stunning forest scenery. As we climb higher, the first glimpses of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges begin to appear. We pass through Ulleri village, a traditional Magar settlement with stone houses and friendly locals. The forest section from Ulleri to Ghorepani is particularly beautiful, with rhododendron trees that burst into brilliant red and pink blooms during spring (March-April). Ghorepani (2,860m) is a lively village situated on a ridge, serving as the main gateway to Poon Hill. The village offers spectacular mountain views and a vibrant atmosphere with multiple teahouses, bakeries, and shops. Overnight in Ghorepani, preparing for tomorrow's pre-dawn hike to Poon Hill.",

    "description": "Wake up early (around 4:00 AM) for the pre-dawn hike to Poon Hill (3,210m) - the highlight of the entire trek! The 45-minute to 1-hour climb in the dark is well worth every step. As you reach the viewpoint, join dozens of trekkers watching the sky transform from deep blue to orange and gold. The sun rises behind the Annapurna range, painting the peaks of Dhaulagiri (8,167m - world's 7th highest), Annapurna I (8,091m), Annapurna South (7,219m), Machhapuchhre (6,993m - Fishtail), Hiunchuli (6,441m), and Tukuche Peak (6,920m) in stunning golden light.

                    The <strong>Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek</strong> is the most popular short trek in Nepal, and for good reason. This classic route offers an unforgettable Himalayan experience in just 4 days of trekking, making it perfect for those with limited time or looking for a gentle introduction to trekking in Nepal.

                    The highlight is the pre-dawn hike to <strong>Poon Hill (3,210m)</strong>, one of the best viewpoints in the Annapurna region. As the sun rises, you'll witness a spectacular panorama of snow-capped peaks including <strong>Dhaulagiri (8,167m)</strong>, <strong>Annapurna I (8,091m)</strong>, Annapurna South, Machhapuchhre (Fishtail), and dozens of other Himalayan giants glowing in golden light - a truly magical experience.

                    Beyond the mountain views, the trek takes you through beautiful rhododendron forests (spectacular in spring), traditional Gurung and Magar villages, and terraced farmlands. You'll experience authentic Nepali village life, visit the charming village of Ghandruk with its Gurung Museum, and enjoy warm hospitality at cozy teahouses. This trek combines natural beauty, cultural experiences, and accessibility into one perfect package.
