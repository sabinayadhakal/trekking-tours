                    The <strong>Khopra Ridge with Khayar Lake Trek</strong> is a hidden gem in the Annapurna region, 
                    offering a peaceful alternative to the more crowded trekking routes like Annapurna Base Camp. 
                    This off-the-beaten-path adventure takes you through dense rhododendron forests, traditional 
                    Gurung villages, and alpine meadows to the spectacular <strong>Khopra Ridge (3,660m)</strong> - 
                    one of the best vantage points in the Himalayas with panoramic views of Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, 
                    Nilgiri, and Machhapuchhre (Fishtail).
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-2 md:mb-4 text-xs md:text-base">
                    The trek's highlight is the challenging day hike to <strong>sacred Khayar Lake (4,660m)</strong>, 
                    a stunning turquoise alpine lake nestled beneath Annapurna South. The lake holds deep religious 
                    significance for both Hindus and Buddhists, who believe that bathing in its waters fulfills wishes. 
                    The trail to the lake offers breathtaking mountain scenery and a true 
                    sense of wilderness adventure.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed text-xs md:text-base">
                    What makes this trek truly unique is the <strong>community-based tourism model</strong> - trekkers 
                    stay in lodges managed by local communities rather than private owners, with profits contributing 
                    to local schools and village projects. Combined with natural hot springs 
                    at Tatopani, rich Gurung and Magar culture, and far fewer trekkers than mainstream routes, this 
                    trek offers an authentic and serene Himalayan experience.
